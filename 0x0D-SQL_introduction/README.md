# SQL - Structured Query Language

__First, what are databases for?__

Storing data in your application (in memory) has the obvious shortcoming that, whatever the technology you’re using, your data dies when your server stops. Some programming languages and/or frameworks take it even further by being stateless, which, in the case of an HTTP server, means your data dies at the end of an HTTP request. Whether the technology you’re using is stateless or stateful, you will need to persist your data somewhere. That’s what databases are for.

## MySQL
