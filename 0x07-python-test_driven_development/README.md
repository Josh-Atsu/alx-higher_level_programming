#PYTHON TEAS DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown.

What is Doctest?
Doctest is an inbuilt test framework that comes bundled with Python by default. The doctest module searches for code fragments that resemble interactive Python sessions and runs those sessions to confirm they operate as shown.

What is Unittest?
Unittest test case runners allow more options when running tests, like reporting test statistics such as tests that passed and failed.

Unittest uses methods created in classes to manage tests. It has support for automation, setup, and shutdown code when testing. Unittest has several rich, in-built features that are unavailable in doctest, including generators and group fixture managers like setUp and tearDown.
