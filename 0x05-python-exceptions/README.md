#Python Exceptions
Errors and exceptions in Python are both types of issues that can occur during program execution.

Errors in Python are typically caused by syntax mistakes or issues that prevent the code from running at all. These errors are detected during the parsing of the code and are known as syntax errors.

Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of the code. They are not necessarily fatal to the program and can be handled using try-except blocks. Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, division by zero, or trying to access a non-existent file.
